## Overview
This project was suppossed to use Redux, that's why 'Pokedux' but at the end I used Hooks and applied some performance methods to emulate Redux behaviour

## Features
The project is optimized in terms of performance (avoiding unnecessary renders) and it has interesting features such as a complete state management system created with useContext and a infinite scroll created with the IntersectionObserver API. Finally, it has the ability to store pokemons in the local storage

## Technologies
In order to create this project, I used:
- Vite (a simil to CRA) but with less stuff built-in
- React.js
- Sass preprocessor
- TypeScript
- Pokemon API

## Contribute
You are welcome to contribute, just create a new branch with a self-describing title and do the PR
